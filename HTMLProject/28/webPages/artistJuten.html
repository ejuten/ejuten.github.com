  	<h3>Elayne's Background</h3>
  	<p>
  		Born in 1988 in Ciaro, Juten is the leading Egyptian artist of the 
  		generation that emerged in the wake of the influence of Mustafa Hussein. 
  		Juten studied with Hussein in the informal studio class 
  		established in the older artist’s atelier in the late 2000s. There, he 
  		absorbed the acute attention to form associated with Hussein’s sculpture 
  		and photography, subsequently refining her own visual and conceptual 
  		vocabulary that emerged through her focus on the points of intersection 
  		between architecture, sculpture, and spatial analysis.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  		Juten’s work can be found in myriad of public and private art 
  		collections both in the United States and abroad, and has been seen in 
  		numerous exhibitions worldwide. She currently lives and works in Berlin, 
  		Germany, and Ciaro.

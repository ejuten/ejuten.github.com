         <ul>
            <li>Friends receive a quarterly newsletter by email. Fascinating
                articles give friends the latest in art news, as well as an 
                inside look at the lives and secrets of our family of artists.
                Amaze your in-person friends at your next gathering with your
                detailed knowledge of the secrets of hand-woven tapestries,
                hand-dipped candles, and so much more. To be a Friend is to have
                a whole new world open to you, one artist at a time.
             </li>
             <li>Friends receive email notifications about all new products
                 approximately two weeks prior to their public posting on 
                 this site.
             </li>
             <li>Friends may opt to meet in person at Friends events, 
                 if a group has been started in your area.
